        <h5>Nutrition can affect our mood</h5>

        <p>Science has found that what we eat can affect our mood. So maybe choose your snacks with that in mind. Look for foods high in magnesium, zinc, B-vitamins, and Omega-3 fatty acids. Also there is strong evidence for including anti-oxidants and probiotics, a healthy gut helps with the production of serotonin, one of the "happy hormones". <br>
          Conversely, there are also foods that can bring us down, and increase our feelings of anxiety. Foods that quickly ramp up our system, but are often followed by a crash just as quickly.
